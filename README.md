Project Description
-------------------
BeerCompass is a mobile first app that enhances the experience of an evenings drinking. Find bars, find your drinking team, located cash, bars, deals, and allow vendors to post specials on the fly during the evenings festivites. 

Find your way home, track your movements, take memorable photos (and immemorable). Take down phone numbers and personal details. Even filter with beer googles.

Want food. No problem. List all the eateries open in your locale.
