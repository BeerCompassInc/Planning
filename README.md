 * As a user I want to add a sentence(s) to a story. 
 * As a user I want to see the last line of a story I'm contributing to.
 * As a user I want to invite other users to add to a story.
 * As a user I want to be able to set when a story will complete.
 * As a user I want to view completed stories I contributed to.
 * As a user I want to be notified when it's time for me to contribute to a story.
