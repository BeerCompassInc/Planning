Project overview, user stories, learning objectives... 

Project Description
-------------------
Gretel is an app inspired by the [exquisite corpse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) writing game. The app adds a geolocation element to the game where participants must physically go to the location of a story to be able to contribute. 

The app has a Rails backend for user authentication and the db of stories and contributions. 
There is a phone app for ios and android built on cordova. 
There is also a responsive desktop version of the app.
