All the fun stuff we'd like to add...

* Photos taken that added to route view.
* Live tracking of friends (who also use app) location on a night out.
* Filter over map:  Show Bars, Food outlets, Taxi Stands, ATMs
* Potential for bars to push in advertising:  Events/Bands/Specials
* Take photos of people you meet and append with contact details
* Publish as a phone app (phone gap/cordova) and publish to Google Play Store
